A small Raknet study I did in high school. At the time, I was interested in network programming and Raknet seemed to have all the tools. So, I gave it a shot.

**Instructions**

To run the program, please first double click the "Networking.exe" file inside the "Server" directory. Then, run as many instances of the "Star Engine.exe" inside the "Client" Directory. The multiple clients will be connected and synchronized using the server.
Going near the purple ball will cause players to be injured.

For the server : 
To Quit : Press Escape or hit x

For the client :
Left click to move around
